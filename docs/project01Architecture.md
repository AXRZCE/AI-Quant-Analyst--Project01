# Project01 Architecture

## Overview

Project01 is an AI-driven quantitative analyst platform designed to predict stock market movements by ingesting high-frequency market data, news, social media sentiment, and macroeconomic indicators. It processes and stores data in a lakehouse, computes features, trains both baseline and state-of-the-art models, serves predictions via APIs and dashboards, and monitors performance and drift.
