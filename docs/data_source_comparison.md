## Use Cases in Project01

### When to Use Polygon.io

- When high-quality, official data is required
- For real-time trading applications
- When accessing specialized data (options, forex, crypto)
- For production environments
- When using websockets for streaming data

### When to Use Yahoo Finance

- As a fallback when Polygon.io is unavailable
- For development and testing
- When working within rate limits
- For basic historical price analysis
- When cost is a primary concern

## Integration in Project01

The application is designed to use both data sources effectively:

1. **Primary Source**: Polygon.io is used as the primary data source
2. **Fallback Mechanism**: Yahoo Finance is used as a fallback when Polygon.io fails
3. **Caching**: Both sources use caching to reduce API calls
4. **Normalization**: Data from both sources is normalized to a common format
5. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures the application continues to function even if one source fails

## Recommendations

- **Development**: Use Yahoo Finance during development to avoid consuming Polygon.io API quota
- **Testing**: Test with both data sources to ensure the application works with either
- **Production**: Use Polygon.io as the primary source in production
- **Monitoring**: Monitor API usage and errors for both sources
- **Fallback**: Always implement the fallback mechanism to ensure data availability
