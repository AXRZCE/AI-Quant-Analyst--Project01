# Advanced Models Integration Documentation

This document provides an overview of the advanced models integration for the AI Quant Analyst project.

## Overview

The advanced models integration enhances the prediction capabilities of the AI Quant Analyst project by incorporating:

1. **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)**: A state-of-the-art deep learning model for time series forecasting
2. **FinBERT**: A BERT-based model for financial sentiment analysis
3. **Model Ensembling**: Techniques for combining multiple models to improve prediction accuracy
4. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Methods for estimating prediction uncertainty

These components are integrated into a unified prediction pipeline that can be used for making predictions with confidence intervals and uncertainty estimates.

## Components

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.models.prediction_pipeline import create_prediction_pipeline

# Create prediction pipeline
pipeline = create_prediction_pipeline(
    use_ensemble=True,
    use_advanced_models=True,
    use_uncertainty=True,
    ensemble_type="weighted",
    uncertainty_method="bootstrap"
)

# Load models
pipeline.load_models()

# Make predictions
predictions = pipeline.predict(X)

# Access predictions with uncertainty
print(f"Prediction: {predictions['prediction'].iloc[-1]}")
print(f"Confidence interval: [{predictions['lower_bound'].iloc[-1]}, {predictions['upper_bound'].iloc[-1]}]")
print(f"Uncertainty: {predictions['uncertainty'].iloc[-1]}")
```

### Using TFT for Time Series Forecasting

```python
from src.models.advanced_models import TFTWrapper

# Create TFT wrapper
tft = TFTWrapper()

# Prepare data
tft.prepare_data(df)

# Make predictions
predictions = tft.predict(df)

# Get prediction intervals
lower, upper = tft.predict_interval(df)
```

### Using FinBERT for Sentiment Analysis

```python
from src.models.advanced_models import FinBERTWrapper

# Create FinBERT wrapper
finbert = FinBERTWrapper()

# Analyze sentiment
texts = ["The company reported strong earnings, beating analyst expectations."]
sentiments = finbert.analyze(texts)

# Get sentiment features
sentiment_df = finbert.get_sentiment_features(texts)
```

### Creating Model Ensembles

```python
from src.models.ensemble import create_ensemble

# Create base models
models = [
    ("rf", RandomForestRegressor()),
    ("gb", GradientBoostingRegressor()),
    ("xgb", XGBRegressor())
]

# Create ensemble
ensemble = create_ensemble(
    models,
    ensemble_type="weighted",
    optimize_weights=True
)

# Fit ensemble
ensemble.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = ensemble.predict(X_test)

# Get prediction intervals
lower, upper = ensemble.predict_interval(X_test)
```

### Using Uncertainty Quantification

```python
from src.models.uncertainty import create_uncertainty_quantifier

# Create uncertainty quantifier
uncertainty = create_uncertainty_quantifier(
    model,
    method="bootstrap",
    n_estimators=100
)

# Fit uncertainty quantifier
uncertainty.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = uncertainty.predict(X_test)

# Get prediction intervals
lower, upper = uncertainty.predict_interval(X_test)
```

## API Integration

The advanced models are integrated into the API through the `advanced_predict.py` module, which provides:

1. **Advanced Prediction Endpoint**: `/api/predict/advanced` for making predictions with advanced models
2. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when advanced models are not available
3. **Caching**: Efficient caching of predictions for improved performance

Example API request:

```python
import requests

# API endpoint
url = "http://localhost:8000/api/predict/advanced"

# API key
headers = {
    "X-API-Key": "your_api_key"
}

# Request data
data = {
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "days": 30
}

# Make request
response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)

# Parse response
result = response.json()

print(f"Prediction: {result['predicted_return']}")
print(f"Confidence interval: {result['confidence_interval']}")
print(f"Sentiment: {result['sentiment']}")
```

## Model Registry and Selection

The advanced models integration includes a model registry and selection framework:

1. **Model Registry**: Tracks and manages trained models
2. **Model Selection**: Selects the best model based on performance metrics
3. **Model Comparison**: Compares models based on various metrics

Key features:
- Versioning of models
- Performance tracking
- Automatic selection of best models
- Visualization of model comparisons

## Best Practices

1. **Use Ensembles for Critical Predictions**: Ensemble models generally provide more robust predictions than single models.
2. **Always Include Uncertainty Estimates**: Uncertainty estimates are crucial for financial decision-making.
3. **Combine Technical and Sentiment Features**: The combination of technical indicators and sentiment analysis often provides better predictions.
4. **Regularly Update Models**: Financial markets change over time, so models should be regularly retrained.
5. **Monitor Model Performance**: Track model performance over time to detect degradation.
6. **Use Cross-Validation**: Always use proper time series cross-validation to avoid look-ahead bias.
7. **Consider Multiple Time Horizons**: Different models may perform better at different time horizons.

## Limitations and Future Work

Current limitations:
- TFT requires significant computational resources for training
- FinBERT is limited to English text
- Uncertainty estimates may be overconfident in extreme market conditions
- Model ensembling increases inference time

Future work:
- Integration of reinforcement learning for trading strategies
- Support for multi-asset portfolio optimization
- Improved handling of market regime changes
- Integration of alternative data sources
- Distributed training and inference

## Conclusion

The advanced models integration provides a comprehensive framework for making predictions with state-of-the-art models, ensembling, and uncertainty quantification. By combining these components, the AI Quant Analyst project can provide more accurate and robust predictions for financial decision-making.
