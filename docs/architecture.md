# Project01: AI-Quant-Analyst Architecture

## Overview

Project01 is an AI-driven quantitative analyst platform that uses machine learning to predict financial market movements and execute trading strategies. The platform ingests data from various sources, processes it through a data pipeline, trains machine learning models, and deploys them for real-time inference.

## System Architecture

The system architecture consists of the following components:

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer

- **Data Sources**:
  - Market data from Polygon.io API
  - News data from NewsAPI
  - Social media sentiment from Twitter API

- **Streaming Pipeline**:
  - Kafka topics for ticks, news, and tweets
  - Producers for each data source
  - Consumers for data processing

### 2. Data Processing Layer

- **Data Lakehouse**:
  - Raw data stored in Delta Lake format
  - Data partitioned by date
  - Batch and streaming feature engineering

- **Feature Store**:
  - Feast for feature registry and serving
  - Batch features for model training
  - Online features for real-time inference

### 3. Model Training Layer

- **Baseline Models**:
  - XGBoost for regression
  - Feature importance analysis
  - Hyperparameter tuning

- **Advanced Models**:
  - Temporal Fusion Transformer for time-series forecasting
  - FinBERT for sentiment analysis
  - Reinforcement Learning for trading strategies

- **Experiment Tracking**:
  - MLflow for experiment tracking
  - Model versioning and artifact storage
  - Performance metrics and visualizations

### 4. Serving Layer

- **Model Serving**:
  - BentoML for model packaging and serving
  - RESTful API for predictions
  - Batch and real-time inference

- **Trading Strategies**:
  - Backtesting framework
  - Strategy evaluation
  - Portfolio optimization

### 5. Monitoring & Observability

- **Metrics Collection**:
  - Prometheus for metrics collection
  - Grafana for dashboards
  - Alerting for anomalies

- **Drift Detection**:
  - Evidently for data and model drift detection
  - Scheduled drift reports
  - Automated retraining triggers

### 6. Orchestration & Deployment

- **Workflow Orchestration**:
  - Airflow for workflow orchestration
  - DAGs for data processing, model training, and deployment

- **Containerization & Deployment**:
  - Docker for containerization
  - Kubernetes for deployment
  - CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## Deployment Architecture

The deployment architecture consists of the following components:

### 1. Development Environment

- Local development with Docker Compose
- Unit tests and integration tests
- Code quality checks with flake8 and black

### 2. Staging Environment

- Kubernetes cluster for staging
- Automated deployment with GitHub Actions
- End-to-end testing

### 3. Production Environment

- Kubernetes cluster for production
- Blue-green deployment
- Autoscaling based on load

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Market data, news, and social media data are ingested through APIs
   - Data is published to Kafka topics

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Raw data is stored in Delta Lake
   - Features are extracted and stored in Feast

3. **Model Training**:
   - Features are used to train machine learning models
   - Models are evaluated and registered in MLflow

4. **Model Serving**:
   - Models are packaged with BentoML
   - Models are deployed as RESTful APIs

5. **Trading Strategies**:
   - Predictions are used to generate trading signals
   - Signals are backtested and evaluated

6. **Monitoring & Observability**:
   - Metrics are collected and visualized
   - Drift is detected and alerts are triggered

## Technology Stack
